                <h3>Luxury Cruise Suites</h3>
                <p class="sub-heading">Your Space - The Greatest Luxury at Sea</p>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>Silversea’s suites offer one of the highest space-per-guest ratios of any luxury cruise accommodations. All Silversea suites have ocean views, and most include a private teak veranda so that you can breathe in the fresh sea air simply by stepping outside your door. And regardless of the ship or suite category, all guests will be pampered with the personalised services of an attentive butler.</p>

                    <p>For a truly personal experience, customise your suite with an abundance of thoughtful options and luxurious amenities from Bvlgari toiletries and personalised stationary to a bar with your favourite wines and liquors. Settle in with a complimentary movie or choose instead to simply watch the ocean swim by. You can even have dinner in-suite served course by course by your butler. Then, when it’s time to retire, curl up beneath Egyptian cotton linens and a fluffy duvet, with your choice of nine different pillow types. The ultimate in luxury cruise accommodations, Silversea’s suites are your home away from home.</p>

                <h3>Dining Options On-board</h3>
                <p class="sub-heading">A Tribute to Your Great Taste</p>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>With the importance of food in Italian culture, you would expect dining to be a high priority at Silversea. And it most assuredly is. Moreover, gastronomic excellence is a given thanks to Silversea’s partnership with the prestigious Grands Chefs Relais & Châteaux. No matter where you dine, their influence is readily apparent in the great diversity and presentation of culinary selections on board your all inclusive cruise. </p>

                    <p>Silversea offers a choice of dining venues, even aboard their smallest ships, and as many as six restaurants on Silver Spirit — remarkable for a ship of her size. The main dining room aboard every Silversea luxury cruise ship, The Restaurant, is always open seating so you can arrive at your leisure and dine with the friends you invite to join your table. And with the worldly crowd of international guests who sail on Silversea ships, socialising is yet another great advantage of the Silversea experience.</p>

                <h3>Evening  Activities</h3>
                <p class="sub-heading">A Night on the Town</p>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>The ease of enjoying a night on the town is one of the great benefits of an all-inclusive cruise. Especially when just steps from your door you can mingle with the interesting, international guests who prefer Silversea ships.</p>
                    <p>Begin with a cocktail at one of the bars where a lively crowd has gathered to trade tales of the day’s adventures. How relaxing to know nobody need reach for the bill. The friendly conversation continues during dinner where you can linger over coffee — but don’t miss tonight’s performance.</p>
                    <p>In the Show Lounge, an expectant hush gives way to applause as the curtain opens on an energetic production show or with a celebrated pianist you’ve seen on TV. If you prefer, try your luck at roulette or take in a movie under the stars. And if you’re a dance aficionado, you will not be alone. Dance hosts are available on many Silversea cruises. Or take a quiet stroll out on deck and let the romance of the sea work its magic.</p>
